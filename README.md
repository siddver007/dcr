# django-celery-redis-async-server
This is a django project with a django app to give you the idea how celery can be used with django to create an API server to handle async requests. This Django-server let's you create requests running for a specified time, get running requests, kill a specific request, and get time remaining for the active requests. This is a fairly basic example with the motive of only showing how celery can be used with Django to create a Top-Notch RESTful server.
